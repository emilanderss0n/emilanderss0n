## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modding for Single Player Tarkov, NHLPLAY - Advanced NHL statistics website & other web/app projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more C# and 3D modeling
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about texturing and graphics (20 years of experience)
- âš¡ I know how to make "digital things" look and feel professional (without using AI, but I still use it because it saves time)
